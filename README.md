API for PlayerData Bukkit Plugin
==
* Plugin is located at http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/playerdata/

This is the API for PlayerData. Documentation coming soon.

To start using the API you will want to get a 'PlayerHandler' object. This can be gotten from 'PlayerDataStatic'.

ALWAYS check the API version in your plugin before using any of the api. The api version can be gotten from PlayerDataStatic.

If the API version does not match the version your plugin is compiled for, you should NOT use the api.
